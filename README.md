This single-chapter TXT reader is a versatile local tool designed for seamless text reading and book management.

It simplifies file handling with intuitive uploads—either by clicking the upload area or dragging files—and validates formats to accept only TXTs. Its smart parser uses enhanced regex to identify chapters (supporting "Chapter X", "第 X 章", and more), splitting texts into readable sections automatically.

For personalized reading, it offers light/dark modes to suit different lighting, 8 font options (e.g., Microsoft YaHei, SimSun), and adjustable font sizes (12-24px) with easy increase/decrease/reset controls.

Navigation is straightforward: bottom buttons for previous/next chapters (auto-disabled when unavailable) and a catalog popup displaying all chapters, with the current one highlighted for quick jumps.

The standout bookshelf feature lets you save books, track progress (with a visual bar showing current/total chapters), and record last read times. It sorts books by recency, filters by "all", "recent (7 days)", or "unfinished", and allows title searches. Removing books is simple too.

All data—bookshelf, progress, settings—is stored locally, preserving your state across sessions. Its responsive design adapts to phones, tablets, and PCs, ensuring a consistent experience everywhere.
